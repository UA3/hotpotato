A software that takes any file that you throw to the Landing Zone and distributes it to a set of hard drives. Usually from one fast storage (NVME) to one of many slow storage (SATA)

Initialy was developed to move Chia blockchain plots from a fast storage (NVME) to many slow hard drives (SATA) in parrallel which gave us better transfer speed reaching 6Gb/s.

This tool can be used as a daizy chaining mechanism to move files between two or more nodes.
